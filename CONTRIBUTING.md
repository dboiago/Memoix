# Contributing to Memoix

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Memoix.

This project is opinionated by design. Contributions are welcome, but they're expected to align with the intent and direction of the app.

If you're looking to add features "because recipe apps usually have them," this may not be the right project.

---

## Project Philosophy

Memoix prioritizes:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Flexibility over rigid structure
- Restraint over feature count
- Real cooking workflows over idealized ones

Some sections are recipes. Others are reference logs, shorthand notes, or memory aids. That distinction is intentional.

Please spend time using the app and reading the code before proposing changes.

## What Makes a Good Contribution

Good contributions tend to:

- Improve correctness, stability, or performance
- Reduce friction in existing workflows
- Clarify UI or data models without adding surface area
- Respect existing patterns and naming conventions
- Be small, focused, and well-reasoned

Refactors are welcome only when they clearly improve readability or maintainability.

## What Will Likely Be Rejected

The following are unlikely to be accepted:

- Gamification (streaks, points, achievements, etc.)
- Social features or feeds
- Beginner-only scaffolding or tutorials
- Features that force structure where flexibility is intentional
- Cosmetic changes without functional justification
- Large rewrites without prior discussion

It's about keeping the tool coherent.

## Issues

If you're opening an issue:

- Be specific
- Include screenshots when relevant
- Explain the impact, not just the behavior
- Avoid "wouldn't it be cool if…" suggestions without context

Bug reports are always welcome.

Feature requests should explain why the existing behavior is insufficient.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR:

- Open an issue or discussion if the change affects behavior or UX
- Keep changes scoped and readable
- Follow existing formatting and structure
- Avoid drive-by cleanup unrelated to the change
- Test on at least one target platform

PRs that add features without discussion may be closed.

## Recipes & Reference Data

If contributing recipes or reference data:

- Follow the existing schema exactly
- Avoid embellishment or editorial tone
- Treat entries as working notes, not blog posts
- Increment versions where required

This repository is not a content farm.

---

## Style & Tone

- Avoid marketing language
- Prefer plain, direct naming
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what*
- UI copy should be concise and literal

If something feels overly clever, it probably doesn't belong.

## Final Note

Memoix started as a personal tool.

The goal of contributions is not to make it bigger — it's to make it truer to how serious cooks actually work.

If that resonates with you, you're welcome here.
